This repo was incredibly helpful in figuring out the PLATIPUS algorithm and code in PyTorch:

Honestly probably could not have finished this thesis without it (Well assuming I finish it anyways). 


Note: Make sure to train models using MAML before trying to run the PLATIPUS testing code. The testing code will try to do a comparison with MAML models.
