This repo was incredibly helpful in figuring out the PLATIPUS algorithm and code in PyTorch:

A more updated version of this codebase (with other models for comparison) can bee found here:
https://github.com/darkreactions/platipus/tree/refactor


Note: Make sure to train models using MAML before trying to run the PLATIPUS testing code. The testing code will try to do a comparison with MAML models.
